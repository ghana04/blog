<meta name="description" content="Just a few thoughts on why we experience a dip in the degree to which we operate in the spirit after short term missions.
Mission conditions are unique
When coming back from short term missions, the following things tend to change quite a bit:

Fellowship of believers: on mission we are surrounded 24/7 by believers who are very zealous for the Lord.
Less distractions: on mission we don&rsquo;t have to concern ourselves with many of the day-to-day responsibilities we have back at home.
Prayers of other believers: on mission we have other believers constantly praying for us, especially if we make a point to organize prayer partners.

When these things fall away, the natural result is that we don&rsquo;t experience the same spiritual walk in our daily lives as we had on the mission.">
