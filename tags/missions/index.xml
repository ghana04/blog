      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a few thoughts on why we experience a dip in the degree to which we operate in the spirit after short term missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mission-conditions-are-unique&#34;&gt;Mission conditions are unique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coming back from short term missions, the following things tend to change quite a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fellowship of believers: on mission we are surrounded 24/7 by believers who are very zealous for the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less distractions: on mission we don&amp;rsquo;t have to concern ourselves with many of the day-to-day responsibilities we have back at home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prayers of other believers covering us: on mission we have other believers constantly praying for us, especially if we make a point to organize prayer partners.
I believe this is the single biggest contributing factor to our experience while on missions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these things, which all have a big impact on our spiritual life, fall away, the natural result is that we don&amp;rsquo;t experience the same level of spiritual empowerment in our daily lives as we had on the mission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
