# Jesus is the Way

No one comes to the Father except through Him.
Those who are in Him, which is a spiritual reality, will see Him manifesting in the natural in their lives:

1. Spending time in the house of the Father.
2. Baptized with the Spirit of God.
3. Led by the Spirit of God.
4. Doing only what pleases God.
5. Taking up the cross and dying.
6. Being resurrected.
