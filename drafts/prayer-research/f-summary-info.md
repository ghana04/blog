## General comments

- Search was done on prayer, but also instances that are prayer were selected.
- Some mentions of prayer are ignored since prayer is only mentioned as an aside, with not much to glean about prayer itself.
  - For example, when there is mention of people going to a place of prayer.
  - The prayer of unbelievers are also left out.

## Type 

1. Exhortation: When someone is exhorted to pray, or exhorted to pray in a specific way or for a specific goal.
2. Instruction: When someone is told how to pray.
3. Example: A recorded prayer.
4. Mention: A reference to an instance of someone praying or to prayer itself.

Although there might be passages that contain both exhortation and instruction, the categorization is done with reference to the primary intent: 

- Exhortation: _you should pray_
- Instruction: This is _how you should pray_

This is indicated by `God the Father (assumed)`
