Praying in the spirit means realizing that the only truly redeemed part of you is your spirit.
You can not approach God's throne room of grace with your natural body, because it is affected by sin and therefore will disintegrate in God's presence.
Praying in the spirit is drawing near to God by faith, knowing that you are granted access as a spiritual reality.

Fortunately this is intuitive enough, since we don't physically experience being taken to God's presence when we pray.
Most believers draw near to God in the spirit probably by virtue only of knowing that it's not a physical reality, since they do not physically find themselves in another place.

Surely the reason why Paul and others uses the phrase "in the spirit" so often is that until we receive our glorified bodies, everything truly of God (good/powerful/holy) occurs in the spirit and doesn't directly touch our natural bodies.

The things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.

This is reflected in the world as well as our bodies.
Our natural bodies are transient, it will be replaced by spiritual bodies.
However, that which is unseen about us (our spirits), are eternal.
And they are either eternally in Christ (life) or eternally outside of Christ (death).

## In the spirit in Paul's writings

_9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you_
~ Romans 1:9

Paul serves God with his spirit, not his soul or his natural body, both of which are affected by the fall.
Since his spirit has become one with Christ, and that it is the Spirit of Christ in him, therefore the service with his spirit is acceptable to God.

_6 But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code._
~ Romans 7:6

The written code demands man to keep himself alive (_But the law is not of faith, rather "The one who does them shall live by them."_).
This is the curse of the fallen world, where Adam keeps himself alive by the sweat of his brow.
However, we have died with Christ to that law, so that being united with him in the spirit we do not keep ourselves alive, but rather we are kept alive by our union to Him.
