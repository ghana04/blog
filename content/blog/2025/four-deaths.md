While on an outreach in India, I thoroughly enjoyed reflecting on the concept of us being crucified with Christ.

## What does it mean to be crucified with Christ?

When Paul says that it is now longer he that lives, but Christ in him, what does he mean?
Clearly he is still biologically alive and has much of his personality in tact.
He is also spiritually alive since he has been regenerated.

## The natural being a reflection of the spiritual

I believe that when Adam sinned in the garden, he actually died as God has said, and that it was both physical and spiritual

## What does death mean?

God is spirit, and therefore I believe He sometimes would speak to a spiritual reality even though the natural has not caught up to it yet.
Much of the Genesis narrative (and other parts of Scripture) make more sense to me if death is seen as _separation_ rather than _cessation_.

God, being eternal, creates things that are eternal.
He has put eternity into the heart of man, His covenants have eternal language, and His punishments are also eternal.
This is probably because in the spirit time doesn't exist.

Therefore, for God, to die is to be separated from the realm of Life, from Him.

When Adam sinned, his spirit died but didn't cease to exist.
Like a flower that has been cut, he still retained some form and processes of life, even though in the spirit he was removed from God and therefore considered dead.
This spiritual reality was then reflected in the natural by Adam being banned from the Garden of Eden, and placed in a cursed land.
Like Adam, the land had some form of life, but at the same time was constantly being affected by the thorns and thistles introduced by the fall.

Why does biological death then still happen?
Biological death is in some way cessation, but it can also be seen as a separation from the biological world.
Biological death is our 3rd death, separating our spirits from the realm of grace.
In that sense, it is a foreshadowing of what is going to happen in the spirit if we don't join with Christ in His death.

## What happened at the cross

When Paul says that we have been crucified with Christ, we need to therefore see it as something that happened in the spirit, and therefore actually occurred before time began.
Our spirit was in some mysterious way joined to Him, and therefore He experienced the spiritual punishment due to us.
Again, the natural follows the spiritual, and we see in the natural suffering of Christ something of the spiritual reality lying behind it:

1. Separation from God.
2. Shame (nakedness).
3. Sweat.
4. Thorns.

As the true Adam, He experiences on the cross the punishment due to those who are in Adam, as is evident by the parallels with the curse pronounced by God in the garden of Eden.

However, Christ was resurrected in the Spirit, which was then reflected in the natural by His physical body being restored.
Because our spirits were joined to His during his crucifixion, we also arose in the spirit with Him.
Therefore we are no longer in the realm of death, but in the spirit we are now in Christ, which is the realm of Life.
This is why I believe Peter goes as far as to say that we become one spirit with Him.

This reality happens to us experientially when we come to faith in Jesus Christ.
We receive a new heart, which is essentially a removal of the spirit that was joined to Adam, and being given the spirit that is in Christ.
This spirit, being connected to the source of Life, naturally starts producing life in us.
We see this reality work it's way out in alcoholics who turn to Christ and stop getting drunk: their physical bodies have more 'life' because of the way that the spiritual reality is bringing itself to bear on the natural.
The same applies to our emotions, previously they were determined by our Adamic nature (spirit), but now they are continuously being reshaped to conform to the underlying spiritual reality. 

## Why should regenerated people die physically

If we have been renewed in our spirits, why do our bodies still die?

Although there has been a profound change in the spirit, something about our bodies still carry the curse of the sin.
The bodies we received from Adam were fit for the spirit we received from him: partial signs of life but spoiled by corruption (manifested in blindness, aging, cancer, loss of hair, etc.).

Therefore, our physical bodies will one day die so that they can be put off.
God is going to give us bodies that match the underlying spiritual condition we are now in, having been joined to Christ.

## Four deaths summarized

Every person has four key experiences of death: 

1. Spiritual death (inherited from Adam): being separated from God in the spiritual realm, evidenced by feelings such as guilt, shame, pride, and wanting to be good/righteous by being moral.
2. Physical death (inherited from Adam): being separated from God in the natural, which is having to 'stay alive' in the world by the sweat of our brow.
3. Physical death (experienced personally): being separated from the life-sustaining and grace-permitting environment which God provided for our bodies and our souls.
4. Spiritual death: 
   1. For unbelievers: called the second death, the lake of fire, which is the final and true separation from the spiritual realm of life (experienced personally).
   2. For believers: being crucified with Jesus and dying with Him (experienced by Jesus in the true sense, experienced daily by believers - as a type - when we take up our cross to follow Him)

## Who does the work?

Work seems to be categorized as either that which we do besides staying alive and that which we do to be able to stay alive.

When Adam worked in the garden, he didn't do it to stay alive.
In that sense, his work was simply to reflect God to creation, to fulfill the mandate provided by God.
He did this whilst God did the 'work' to sustain him by providing trees and a living environment where not not even clothes were needed.

When God cursed creation because of Adam, he had to start working to live since he could no longer just rely on God to keep him biologically alive.
Again, this was a natural reflection of a spiritual reality.
In the spirit, since Adam was cut off from the realm of Life, he would sense the need to be 'good' to be 'spiritually alive'.
The parallel in the natural is clear: work is now needed from Adam to keep himself alive.

Hence why, when God sought to illustrate the realm of the spirit, which is where He lives, the priests weren't allowed to sweat (Ezekiel).
Sweat is connected to Adam's curse of having to keep yourself alive, which is completely foreign for creatures in God's realm.

Therefore, when the Law came, in a type and shadow it gave 'life' to those who obeyed it.
But with the arrival of Christ, and our union with Him by death and resurrection, we don't have to lift a finger to keep ourselves alive.
Rather, like Adam before the fall, we live in a realm where God sustains us, and all the 'work' we do is simply to reflect God to the creation and not to garner spiritual life.
Jesus fulfilled the law, therefore in Him we live.

That is probably why in Galatians Paul is rebuking them, since they are now seeking to do achieve with the shadow of the law what the promise of faith has completed in Christ.

## Good deeds for the Lord

When we do good deeds, we see it as an outflow of Christ in us, and not as some way to maintain life in the spirit.
Christ in us is the hope of glory.

When Christ who is our life appears, then we also will appear with Him in glory.
This verse to me means that when Jesus, who is the realm of Life, to whom I am joined in the spirit, returns, then I will be given my glorified body and appear with the rest of the sons of God to the new creation that awaits us.
