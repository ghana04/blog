Today at a church service we sang Way Maker and I was really grieved in my spirit during that song.
Normally I try to ignore songs that I feel are unhelpful, but today I was so burdened that I felt I had to bring this up.

This song is so very shallow in theology, it feels man-centered and lends itself to viewing God through a "genie in a bottle" lens.
That's not to mention the presumption embedded in the song, which states the following: 

- "You’re moving in our midst"
- "You’re working in this place"
- "You're touching every heart"
- "You're healing every heart"
- "You're mending every heart"

On which scriptural basis do we presume to say these things?
For example, with the issue of 'hearts', surely God does not always do these things to every heart when we sing, since He is also the God who hardens hearts (John 12:40)?

My question is: why do we make God's people sing this song, do we not have better songs that we can sing that would be more beneficial to the congregation?
