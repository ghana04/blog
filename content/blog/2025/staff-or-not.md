Some thoughts after listening to Alex O'Connor bring up this contradiction during a debate, where it seems that Jesus is saying opposite things in the different gospels regarding the taking of a staff on the disciples' journey.

## Applicable verses

_Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts, no bag for your journey, or two tunics or sandals or a staff, for the laborer deserves his food._
~ Matthew 10:9-10

_He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff — no bread, no bag, no money in their belts — but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics._
Mark 6:8-9

_And he said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics._
Luke 9:3

Related passage in Exodus:

_In this manner you shall eat it: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand._
_And you shall eat it in haste, it is the LORD’s Passover._
~ Exodus 12:11

## Arguments that won't work

- It can't be that the gospels are referring to different occasions, it is almost undoubtedly the same sending out, as is evidenced by the similarities and the fact that they all happen before the feeding of the 5000.
- All references to "staff" uses the exact same Greek word, so it's not like Jesus is referring to different things.

## What was Jesus' intent

This contradiction must be considered in light of the entire ministry of Jesus.
Is there any evidence from either of the gospels that Jesus would be particularly concerned with whether a disciple has an external thing such as a staff while proclaiming the kingdom of God?
Or a pair of sandals for that matter?
What evidence from the gospels would support Jesus being pedantic about such a point, and that the disciples would in turn be pedantic about it?

In other words, Jesus surely taught His followers to be primarily concerned about the kingdom of God and having faith in God.
That would be His focus.
If Luke/Mark/Matthew knew that Jesus was incredibly pedantic about what to take along when evangelizing, they would probably have taught it to other disciples.

In Matthew we find a hint of what Jesus intends with this instruction when He states the purpose: "the laborer deserves his food".
This implies that the reason for not taking these things is a call to faith in the provision of God: if He calls us to proclaim the good news of the kingdom, then He will provide for us.

Thus, I assume there were two reasons for Jesus stating this command:
1. Call to faith in the provision of God
2. Theological connection to the Exodus
3. Possibly a theological point to travel light, not to acquire many possessions

Now, bread, bag and money makes sense — it is crucial to provision.
In the same way, two tunics make sense, since one can be sold.
Why would Jesus though prohibit the acquiring of sandals in Matthew, but allow them in Mark?

## My hypothesis

First thing to note is that neither of the writers are trying to provide the exact quotation of Jesus.
Mark is providing a description, whilst Luke’s quote doesn’t include the gold, silver, or copper (his might be considered interesting for Luke, who intended to write a careful account, not to include finer details).

As Jesus sends out the twelve, some of the disciples walked with staffs, maybe even needed them to move long distances.
Others might have wished to acquire one specifically because it would be nice to have for a long journey.

The instruction Jesus gave was to strip the disciples on any reliance on their provision.
No doubt a staff could be traded for something, which would be a temptation for a disciple that did not need it.
As the eyewitness accounts were conveyed, a simultaneous instruction could be related by two disciples:

- For the disciple that doesn’t need a staff: Do not take a staff 
- For the disciple that needs a staff: You may take a staff

Luke’s focus wasn’t on what could be taken with, whether allowed or assumed, he focused on the aspect of not taking anything.
He wasn’t going to list the exceptions, or state the assumed fact that the disciples where allowed to take a belt (or one tunic or pair of sandals for that matter).

Mark is most likely creating a connection with the Exodus.
Note that he specifically mentions the three items that are mentioned in Exodus.
The belt is assumed as something that people would need (along with one tunic), then he mentions the staff provision made for the disciples to whom it applied.
Furthermore, he also mentions the sandals, which (similar to the staff) is allowed, even though Matthew prohibits the purchasing of it.
Again, the issue is not the sandals, but having sandals that are not needed, as that jeopardizes the faith/trust in God.
It’s the spare wheel that would impinge on their faith that God would prevent punctures; or the jerry can that impinges the faith that the fuel God provided is enough.

Matthew’s use of ‘acquire’ puts his account in a slightly different category.
As previously mentions, it sheds light on both the accounts of Mark and Luke: Jesus doesn’t want any additional things being taken on this journey, so that His disciples could recognize Him as the same One who said in Deuteronomy 29:5-6:

5 I have led you forty years in the wilderness.
Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn off your feet.
6 You have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.
