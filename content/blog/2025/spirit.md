My short investigation into the way that the word "spirit" (πνεῦμα) is used in the New Testament.

## The Holy Spirit

Many occurrences of πνεῦμα are for the Holy Spirit, whether directly or indirectly.

_18 This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about:_
_His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit._
~ Matthew 1:18

The Holy Spirit being the agent and the means by which a supernatural occurrence takes place.

_20 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,_
_“Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit._

_11 “I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry._
_He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire._

Even though the Holy Spirit is a personal being, an agent of sorts, the Holy Spirit also seems to be something that we as humans can be immersed in (to use baptism language).

_16 And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him,_
_and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;_

Here the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of God.
Jesus was 'baptized' or 'filled' with the Spirit, that He might be the first among many brothers, who would also be baptized/filled with the Spirit.
