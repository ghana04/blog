My short investigation into the way that the word "spirit" (πνεῦμα) is used in the New Testament.

## The Holy Spirit

Many occurrences of πνεῦμα are for the Holy Spirit, whether directly or indirectly.

_18 This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about:_
_His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit._
~ Matthew 1:18

The Holy Spirit being the agent and the means by which a supernatural occurrence takes place.

_20 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,_
_“Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit._
~ Matthew 1:20

_11 “I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry._
_He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire._
~ Matthew 3:11

Even though the Holy Spirit is a personal being, an agent of sorts, the Holy Spirit also seems to be something that we as humans can be immersed in (to use baptism language).

_16 And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him,_
_and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;_
~ Matthew 3:16

Here the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of God.
Jesus was 'baptized' or 'filled' with the Spirit, that He might be the first among many brothers, who would also be baptized/filled with the Spirit.

_Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil._
~ Matthew 4:1

## The spirit as a 'realm'

_Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven._
~ Matthew 5:3

## Spiritual beings

_16 That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick._
~ Matthew 8:16

In the spiritual realm there are beings, entities, called spirits.
Good spirits are like angels and seraphim, whereas bad spirits are demons, fallen angels.

Demons are not visible to us, but when they occupy a human their life-destroying effects are made manifest in the natural.
This also points to the capacity of a human being to host a spirit (or many).
Man is designed to be able to contain a spirit from outside him.

The intent is that man hosts the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
This will have a good effect on his person.
