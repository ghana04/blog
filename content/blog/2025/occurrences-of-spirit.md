My short investigation into the way that the word "spirit" (πνεῦμα) is used in the New Testament.

## The Holy Spirit

Many occurrences of πνεῦμα are for the Holy Spirit, whether directly or indirectly.

_18 This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about:_
_His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit._
~ Matthew 1:18

The Holy Spirit being the agent and the means by which a supernatural occurrence takes place.

_20 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,_
_“Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit._
~ Matthew 1:20

_11 “I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry._
_He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire._
~ Matthew 3:11

Even though the Holy Spirit is a personal being, an agent of sorts, the Holy Spirit also seems to be something that we as humans can be immersed in (to use baptism language).

_16 And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him,_
_and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;_
~ Matthew 3:16

Here the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of God.
Jesus was 'baptized' or 'filled' with the Spirit, that He might be the first among many brothers, who would also be baptized/filled with the Spirit.

_Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil._
~ Matthew 4:1

## The spirit as a 'realm'

_Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven._
~ Matthew 5:3

## Spiritual beings

_16 That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick._
~ Matthew 8:16

In the spiritual realm there are beings, entities, called spirits.
Good spirits are like angels and seraphim, whereas bad spirits are demons, fallen angels.

Demons are not visible to us, but when they occupy a human their life-destroying effects are made manifest in the natural.
This also points to the capacity of a human being to host a spirit (or many).
Man is designed to be able to contain a spirit from outside him.

The intent is that man hosts the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
This will have a good effect on his person.

## Matthew 10:20 | Spirit of your Father speaking through you

_For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit if your Father speaking through you._
~ Matthew 10:20

Interesting that Jesus calls the Holy Spirit the 'Spirit of your Father'.
In Romans the Spirit is called both the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ: 

_You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you._
_Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him._
~ Rom 8:9

Back to Matthew, it is clear that the Spirit of the Father can 'possess' a person, in some way being in him and able to influence his mind to speak what the Spirit wants him to speak.

So even though we do the actions, Jesus does not attribute them ultimately to us.

In verse 19, Jesus says "what you are to say", attributing the action to the person speaking.
So we can attribute actions to both the person and the spirit inside of them.
However, God knows to whom the action is ultimately attributed.

That is why Jesus can simultaneously say "what you ... say" and "it is not you who speak".
Both are true simultaneously, because of the reality of the spiritual realm.

Likewise, in salvation, we do the good deeds, but it is a reflection of the occupation of the Holy Spirit.
It is as if Jesus could say: "It was not you who fed the poor, but the Spirit inside you."

Question: are all things we do ultimately attributed to an outside spirit?
Either the Holy Spirit or an evil spirit? 
Surely there are some actions where we perform them in just the realm of a spirit, either in Christ or not.

## Matthew 12:18 | I will put my Spirit upon Him

_"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased._
_I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles._

An intricate (necessary?) part of the mission of the Servant is the Spirit of God resting upon Him.

## Matthew 12:28 | By the Spirit that demons are cast out

_But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you._

Jesus uses the Holy Spirit as the means to accomplish this act of casting out demons.

## Matthew 12:31-32 | Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit

_Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven._
_32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come._

Could it be that the offenses in the spirit are much higher than those committed in the flesh?
That we are seeing here perhaps not a specific sin as much as it is a category of sin, i.e., that which is committed against the Spirit

Is there a difference between grieving the Spirit and speaking against Him? 
Surely, for in this context the Spirit is spoken against by attributing to Him the work of Satan.
Grieving the Spirit is surely a completely different thing, one where His work in our lives are frustrated or disregarded.

In this case there seems to be a strong emphasis on the idea of speaking, which ties in to what the Pharisees are doing.
But why would it be less severe for speaking against Christ than against the Spirit?

This reminds me of the Proverbs in chapter 6:

_32 He who commits adultery lacks sense;_
    _he who does it destroys himself._
_33 He will get wounds and dishonor,_
    _and his disgrace will not be wiped away._
_34 For jealousy makes a man furious,_
    _and he will not spare when he takes revenge._
_35 He will accept no compensation;_
    _he will refuse though you multiply gifts._

It is possible that there is a certain relationship between the Father/Son and the Spirit that arouses this type of fury.
If you speak/sin against the Holy Spirit, your disgrace will also not be wiped away.

Maybe something of that relationship is conveyed in these verses:

_You adulterous people!_
_Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?_
_Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God._
_5 Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says,_
_“He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”?_
~ James 4:4-5

## Matthew 12:43-45 | Unclean spirits

_"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none._
_44 Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’_
_And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order._
_45 Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first._
_So also will it be with this evil generation."_

Although spirits live in the realm of the spirit, they are still able to occupy people.
So not just does it seem that we have a spirit, but that our body in some way (whether in physical, soul, or spirit) is able to host another spirit.

Maybe in this section Christ is alluding to the baptism of repentance that John preached, being the act that drove out the spirit.
However, when Christ came, he was not received, and the evil spirits could move back in.

Either we receive Christ by faith, or evil spirits by unbelief.

## Matthew 22:43 | David in the Spirit

_He said to them, “How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, ..._

David's rightful assessment of Jesus is made under the influence of the Spirit.
Reminds me of this verse:

_...For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy._
~ Revelation 19:10

That which is spoken by the Spirit is also enduring.
In David's case it's a special type of enduring, since it's recorded in Scripture.

In our case it would probably be the eternal rewards we'll receive.
That is surely, as far as words go, the things that make for gold and silver and precious stones.

This also reminds me of the affirmation that Jesus gives to John after confessing Him to be the Christ: 

"Flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."

## Matthew 26:41 | The Spirit is willing

_Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation._
_The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak._
~ Matthew 26:41

Prayer is needed to help us overcome the weak flesh.
Also, the spirit here is again something personal.
In a person there is a spirit who is willing, but the flesh (representing the first Adam) is weak with regards to righteousness.

## Matthew 27:50 | Jesus yields His spirit

_And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit._

Here the spirit is something again unique to a person, something belonging to a person.

## Matthew 28:19 | Baptizing in the name of the Spirit

_Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,_

One name, many persons.
Here the Spirit again refers to the divine Spirit.

## Mark 1:8 | He will baptize in the Holy Spirit

Parallel.

## Mark 1:10 | Spirit descending on Jesus

Parallel.

## Mark 1:12 | The Spirit drove Him to the wilderness

Parallel.

## Unclean spirits

Mark 1:23;
1:26-27;
3:11;
3:30;
5:2;
5:8;
5:13;
6:7;
7:25;
9:17;
9:20;
9:25;

Points on the above: 

- Unclean spirits are presented also as 'persons', beings with individual agency.
- They carry knowledge ("I know who you are").
- They speak and act through their hosts.
  Note how in 1:23, a man is said to be in the synagogue, but the crying out is attributed to the spirit.
- They are conscious of their shared existence with other unclean spirits ("Have you come to destroy us?").
- They fear and get anxious, knowing that destruction may come to them.
  When confronted with this, they make a scene.
- The unclean spirits for some reason seek to proclaim who Christ is.
  Maybe to release tension or anxiousness, by bringing to a head the reality that they face.
- They recognize authority in the the realm of the spirit.

Interestingly, Jesus doesn't destroy the unclean spirits.
He casts them out of people, allowing them in one case to enter another host (pigs).
He alludes to their agency, in that after they came out they may decide to return to their host.

In the account of the man from the tombs, there are further interesting points:

- The unclean spirit speaking to Jesus is speaking in the singular and almost always referred to with singular nouns.
- It is almost as if only after the admission that there are many is the plurality of the spirits brought more and more into focus in vv 10-13.

Maybe it is reflecting that in the spirit there is something of the principle of headship also at play.
Maybe there is one spirit speaking, representing the many.
This seems to be supported by the fact that he says "_My_ name is Legion, because _we_ are many."

Furthermore: 

- They do not want to be sent out of the country.
- They can occupy animals as well.
- Their well being/fate is intricately tied to the physical world ('going out of the country' and 'being in something' both a concern to them).

Does that mean that any living physical being can host a spirit?
Possibly parallel to the snake in the garden of eden?

## Mark 8:12 | Jesus sighed deeply in His spirit

_And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said,_
_“Why does this generation seek a sign?_
_Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”_

What happened around Jesus affected Him in His spirit.
What affected His spirit translated over to a physical action, which in this case is His response to the Pharisees.

It should probably be so with us as well.
Not what happens to our emotions, or even our flesh, should primarily determine how we live, but rather the spirit.

This is probably what fasting helps reinforce: not primarily by the signals received by my body do I live, but by how I am led in the spirit.

## Mark 12:36 | David in the Holy Spirit

Parallel.

## Mark 13:11 | Not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit

Parallel to Matthew 10:20.

## Mark 14:38 | The spirit is willing

Parallel to 26:41.

## Luke 1:14-17 | Filled with the Spirit from the womb

_14 And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,_
_15 for he will be great before the Lord._
_And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb._
_16 And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,_
_17 and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,_
_and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared."_

A few interesting things about these verses.
Firstly, being filled with the Spirit here is not the result of a decision, a prayer, or a laying on of hands.
This is of course an exceptional case, so must be seen in that light as well.
However, it does indicate that God can fill someone with the Holy Spirit involuntarily.

Another interesting thing is that phrase "the spirit and power of Elijah".
So John will be filled with the Holy Spirit, but the operation of the Spirit will be similar to that seen in the life of Elijah.
It reminds me of that passage "Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit;" (1 Cor 12:4).
So the same Holy Spirit can be in multiple people, but when someone looks at a person operating by the Spirit they might say he or she is acting in the spirit of a person who likewise ministered in a similar way before.
Again this is probably an exceptional case, relating to specific prophecy being fulfilled.

What is interesting is that God promised that he will send Elijah (Mal 4:5).
Elijah's life seems to be an illustration in this instance of the work of the Spirit that God will do.
Maybe also a prophetic symbol of the precursor to Elisha, who will have a double portion of the Spirit.

## General comment on Luke 1-3

The people of Jesus are filled with the Spirit of Jesus.
Events surrounding His birth and ministry are characterized by the operation of the Spirit.

## Luke 1:35 | The Holy Spirit will come upon you

_And the angel answered her,_
_“The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you;_
_therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God._

The Holy Spirit brings forth the birth of the holy Son of God.
Just so the Holy Spirit is needed in our lives to bring forth Christ.
